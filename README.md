# Crawl Engine

Crawl Engine is a PHP Class that simplifies the Process of Web Crawling by Making you to bother less about all the Regular Expressions happening behind the scenes.

It can automatically Log into Sites given the Login Details and it automatically sends both the login details given and fields already populated by the Server eg.CSRF tokens etc.

It can then fetch data based on parameters given by the User

It also has a static method of fetching data from sites not protected with Login

One should know the HTML layout of the site being visited to be able to use it.

It's still been worked on and more params (ways of getting info from sites) features will be added along the way
also features to be able to log into well protected sites that has advanced bot detections is being built in.

Please any Ideas and contribution will be Appreciated.
